# Andyproject-API
Hello, the Andyproject API offers several APIs. <br>
Here is some information about the API and how to use it. 
<br>
# Info
- The API is free and will be in the future. However, I reserve the right to charge for some features, otherwise my costs may become too high.
- The API is maintained in different versions. The new version is always supported. Older versions are available but may be slow and out of date.
- The instructions and information on how to use them can be found in the various folders.
- The project is not yet open source. But this should change in the future. Possible upcoming costly features will not be open source.

# About Me
I'm Andy and I'm training to be a system integrator. In my spare time I like to work with backend systems. Sometimes I try to do some light programming in Python and PHP. My API is completely based on PHP.  I got the idea when I wrote a script in Python to automatically create images with quotes and post them on Instagram. To get more quotes in English and German I started to build a database with quotes and offer them via an API.
<br>
<br>
My goal is, among other things, to build the largest database of German citations. This includes just about 3000 quotes. There are so many more quotes that can be added to the database. For this I will build a small website where you can send in quotes.

# Andyproject API
Here I would like a list of useful API endpoints. The Andyproject API offers several <br>
endpoints for free for projects. Of course a donation would be appreciated <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/andyproject">Buy me a coffee</a>.

Have fun developing your application. Please note that this API can not be used for commercial purposes, because this API is not vulnerable. It is a hobby project.
